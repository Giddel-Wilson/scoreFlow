# HOD (Head of Department) Functionality Summary

## Overview
ScoreFlow now has complete HOD functionality with three department heads properly set up and department-based report filtering.

## HOD Setup
✅ **Three HODs Created** - One for each department:
- **Computer Science**: Prof. David Wilson (hod.cs@university.edu)
- **Information Technology**: Prof. James Thompson (hod.it@university.edu)  
- **Cyber Security**: Prof. Lisa Martinez (hod.cybersec@university.edu)

## Authentication & Access
✅ **Role-Based Access Control**:
- HODs can only access HOD routes (`/hod/*`)
- Each HOD sees only their department's data
- Proper authentication via JWT tokens
- Department-specific data isolation

## HOD Dashboard Features
✅ **Department-Specific Dashboard** (`/hod`):
- Overview of courses in HOD's department only
- Submission statistics (total courses, submitted, pending)
- Recent submissions (last 7 days) from department courses
- List of lecturers in the department
- Quick access to detailed reports

✅ **Department-Specific Reports** (`/hod/reports`):
- Detailed course reports for department courses only
- Cross-departmental student enrollment tracking
- Course performance statistics
- Downloadable Excel reports
- Submission status tracking

## Data Filtering & Security
✅ **Proper Department Filtering**:
- All queries filter by `departmentId` to ensure data isolation
- HODs cannot see other departments' courses or data
- Cross-departmental students are tracked but only for courses in HOD's department
- Recent submissions filtered by course department

✅ **Cross-Departmental Support**:
- Students from any department can enroll in any course
- HODs can see students from other departments taking their courses
- Reports show which students are from other departments
- Proper tracking of "borrowed" courses and carry-overs

## UI/UX Features
✅ **HOD-Specific Navigation**:
- Dedicated HOD layout with navigation menu
- Clear department identification in headers
- Professional dashboard design
- Responsive design for all devices

✅ **Report Functionality**:
- Visual statistics cards
- Detailed course breakdown tables
- Cross-departmental student tracking
- Export functionality for reports

## Technical Implementation
✅ **Database Schema**:
- Proper User-Department relationships
- Role-based access (`Role.HOD`)
- Department foreign keys for data isolation

✅ **Server-Side Logic**:
- `+page.server.ts` files handle department filtering
- Proper authentication checks
- Efficient database queries with proper joins

✅ **Frontend Components**:
- Svelte components for dashboard and reports
- Proper type safety with TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Testing Results
✅ **Verified Functionality**:
- All three HODs exist in database
- Department filtering works correctly
- No data leakage between departments
- Cross-departmental students properly tracked
- Reports generate correctly for each department

## Login Credentials
All HODs use the same password: `password123`

- **CS HOD**: `hod.cs@university.edu`
- **IT HOD**: `hod.it@university.edu` 
- **Cyber Security HOD**: `hod.cybersec@university.edu`

## Summary
The HOD functionality is **fully implemented and tested**. Each department has its own HOD who can:

1. **View department-specific dashboards** with relevant statistics
2. **Generate detailed reports** for their department's courses
3. **Track cross-departmental enrollments** (students from other departments)
4. **Monitor submission status** and lecturer performance
5. **Export reports** for administrative purposes

Reports are properly filtered by course department, ensuring each HOD only sees data relevant to their department while still tracking cross-departmental student enrollments.
