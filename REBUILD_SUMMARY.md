## ðŸ§ª TESTING RESULTS

All backend logic has been thoroughly tested:
- âœ… Authentication: Dr. Michael Brown (michael.brown@university.edu)
- âœ… Course Access: CSC302 (ID: 4) - Software Engineering
- âœ… Student Loading: 2 students found (Alice Johnson, Charlie Brown)
- âœ… Data Structure: Page data loads correctly
- âœ… Score Validation: Proper validation (0-30, no negatives, no letters)

## ðŸš€ HOW TO TEST THE PAGE

### Step 1: Login
1. Open browser to: http://localhost:5174/login
2. Login with:

- "Submit Scores" finalizes and prevents further editing
- Success/error messages appear at top

### When Adding Students:
- Modal opens with name and registration number fields
- Validates required fields
- Adds student to same level (300) and department (Computer Science)

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Schema:
- Course 4 (CSC302) assigned to Dr. Michael Brown
- Students in Computer Science, Level 300
- CAScore table tracks individual scores per lecturer
- Unique constraint on (courseId, studentId)

### Security:
- Role-based access (LECTURER only)
- Course assignment verification
- Prevents editing after submission
- Input validation on both client and server

### Performance:
- Efficient queries with proper joins
- Single transaction for score updates
- Optimistic UI updates with loading states

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS

The page is now fully functional. To continue development:

1. **Test thoroughly** in the browser following the steps above
2. **Add features** like bulk import, score statistics, etc.
3. **Enhance UI** with additional validation or styling
4. **Add audit logging** for score changes (partially implemented)
